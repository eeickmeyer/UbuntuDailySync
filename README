Ubuntu Daily Sync

This set of scripts uses zsync to synchronize the daily Ubuntu ISO images
and includes scripts for downloading beta and final release images.

Requires: zsync


Installation:
Clone this git repository to any directory of your choosing. Make sure all
scripts are executable (chmod +x -r *)

Usage: sync-dailies [newcycle|newconfig <codename> <releaseversion>]
                    [setmirror <URL>]
                    [unsetmirror]

newcycle     Updates configuration with new codename, release version,
             and performs sync
newconfig    Creates configuration file with new codename, release
             version, and exits
setmirror    Sets mirror URL (format: without trailing /)
             NOTE: Must be http URL, zsync doesn't work with https
unsetmirror  Sets mirror to default (http://cdimage.ubuntu.com)


Additionally, each flavor has a "sync-iso.sh" script called by the
main script, but each one can be used individually. For example:

cd Kubuntu
./sync-iso.sh

If no config file exists (as created by the main script) one must specify a
codename here. For example:

./sync-iso.sh focal

will download the latest focal daily image.

You can also specify the input file. For instance, Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu
Kylin have a lot of similarities. If you already have the daily image of 
Ubuntu MATE but want to download Ubuntu Kylin's daily image:

cd Ubuntu\ Kylin
./sync-iso -i ../Ubuntu\ MATE/focal-desktop-amd64.iso

would sync using Ubuntu MATE's image as the base file, only having to download
a fraction of the entire .iso file.


Also included are scripts to download the beta and final release images (when
available) for whichever cycle is already configured. To accomplish this,
simply run:

./get-betas

  - or -

./get-release

This will download the beta or release images to the proper directory in the
current directory. For instance, focal beta would be in the "20.04-beta"
directory while the final release would be in the "20.04-release" directory.
