Ubuntu Daily Sync

This set of scripts uses zsync to synchronize the daily Ubuntu ISO images

Requires: zsync

Installation:
Clone this git repository to any directory of your choosing. Make sure all
scripts are executable (chmod +x -r *)

Usage: sync-dailies [newcycle|newconfig <codename> <releaseversion>]
                    [setmirror <URL>]
                    [unsetmirror]

newcycle     Updates configuration with new codename, release version,
             and performs sync
newconfig    Creates configuration file with new codename, release
             version, and exits
setmirror    Sets mirror URL (format: without trailing /)
             NOTE: Must be http URL
unsetmirror  Sets mirror to default (http://cdimage.ubuntu.com)


Additionally, each flavor has a "sync-iso.sh" script called by the
main script, but each one can be used individually. For example:

cd Kubuntu
./sync-iso.sh

If no config file exists (as created by the main script) one must specify a
codename here. For example:

./sync-iso.sh focal

will download the latest focal daily image.

You can also specify the input file. For instance, Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu
Kylin have a lot of similarities. If you already have the daily image of 
Ubuntu MATE but want to download Ubuntu Kylin's daily image:

cd Ubuntu\ Kylin
./sync-iso -i ../Ubuntu\ MATE/focal-desktop-amd64.iso

would sync using Ubuntu MATE's image as the base file, only having to download
a fraction of the entire .iso file.


Also included is a script to download the beta images for whichever cycle
is already downloaded. To accomplish this, simply run:

./get-betas

This will download the beta images to the release-beta folder in the current
directory. For instance, focal beta would be in the folder "20.04-beta".
